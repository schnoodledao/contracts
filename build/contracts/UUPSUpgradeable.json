The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy.

The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism. _Available since v4.1._",

Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier."
